# Hello, I'm Trent Yetzer! 

I currently working as a Software Engineer at **C.H. Robinson** for the **Robinson Fresh** brand specifically near Minneapolis, and my work involes working with the full technology stack—from database design to backend services to modern web frontends—while leveraging a broad set of technologies including SQL, C#, .NET, TypeScript, React, Azure Pipelines, and Adobe Analytics. My hobbies include **Reading**, **Working Out**, **Cooking**, **Video Games**, and **Anime**.  As a software developer, my favorite languages are **TypeScript**, **C#**, **Python**, and **Go** as of recently. Please feel free to look at my portfolio ~~http://trentyetzer.me/~~ (currently down).
